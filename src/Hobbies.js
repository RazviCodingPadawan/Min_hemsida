                <h3>Fishing</h3>
                <p>Fishing i'ts like yoga for me. I feel all of my body relaxed and I don't even notice when 8 hours 
                    have passed :). I like to fish every season of the year and sometimes I can be gone for few 
                    days on a fishing trip. It's fun and relaxing!</p>
                <h3>Video Games</h3>
                <p>I love video games, both for PC and console. Until 2013 I played only on PC but after 2013 I 
                    started the transition to console world. It began with PS3 and God of War games. After PS3 I 
                    bought PS4 of course and in 2019 i sold my gaming PC that i built myself from scratch and bought 
                    Xbox One X because I Wanted to play all the Halo games and Gears of Wars series. Now after 
                    2 years It's time to upgrade to the latest Xbox console</p>
                <h3>Building Stuff</h3>
                <p>I like to make puzzle. I framed my 500, 1000 and 2000 pieces puzzles.</p>
                <p>I love Lego</p>
                <p>IoT stuff. I built my own temperature and humidity sensor and it was exciting. My second project 
                    will be a water pump for plants</p>
                <h3>Board Games</h3>
                <p>I like to play board games with my friends. Every type of game is welcomed in my house.</p>
